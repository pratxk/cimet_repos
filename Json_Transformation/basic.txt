1. Extract all student names and their GPAs (calculated from grades)

    Calculate GPA based on assignments (40%), midterm (30%), and final (30%)

    GPA = (assignment weightage + midterm weightage + final weightage) / 20

    OUTPUT: [{name, id, gpa}, {name, id, gpa}...]

2. Create a list of all courses with their schedules

    OUTPUT: [ 
        {courseId, title, credits, schedule: {days: [], time, room} }, 
        {courseId, title, credits, schedule: {days: [], time, room} },...
    ]

3. Generate a faculty directory with contact inOUTPUTion

    OUTPUT: [ 
        {departmentName, departmentId, faculty: {name, id, email, qualifications: [], researchAreas: []} }, 
        {departmentName, departmentId, faculty: {name, id, email, qualifications: [], researchAreas: []} }..., 
    ]
